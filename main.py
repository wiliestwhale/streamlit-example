    # About Us
    Hello there. This is William Lau from the GovTech Digital Governance Group. 
    
    This is my submission of the capstone project (Type C) for the inaugural GovTech AI Champions Bootamp. 
    
    Many thanks to Nick and team for preparing and conducting the course. It was tough but I'm glad I went through it.
    
    GenAI is earth-shakingly powerful and ushers some brave new world. Which is ultimately better for everyone, I sincerely hope.
    
    There is much to explore and get better at.

    ## Project Scope

    The domain area that I've focused on for the capstone project is:
   
    * __Understanding CPF (Central Provident Fund) Policies__

    ## Objectives

    Objectives for the two use cases implemented are:

    1. __CPF Contribution AI__
    
       * Use GenAI with charts to help enhance understanding of citizen users of their CPF contributions based on their citizenship status, age, employment status and wages.
    -----

    2. __CPF Withdrawal AI__
    
       * Use GenAI with charts to help enhance understanding of citizen users of CPF withdrawals based on their age and the total CPF savings accumulated.

    ## Data Sources

   Key data sources for the two use cases implemented are:

    1. __CPF Contribution AI__
    
       * CPF Contribution Rates from 1 Jan 2024 (converted to JSON)
         * https://www.cpf.gov.sg/content/dam/web/employer/employer-obligations/documents/CPF_contribution_rates_from_1_Jan_2024.pdf

    -----

    2. __CPF Withdrawal AI__

        * CPF Withdrawl Rules (converted to JSON)
          * https://www.cpf.gov.sg/content/dam/web/member/faq/retirement-income/documents/withdrawal-rules-table.pdf

    ## Features

    Both use cases share the following common features:
    * Citizen users is first asked to enter relevant details in a form which is included into the prompt to enhance context.

    * Application will first check if user query is relevant to the topic at hand before responding.

    * Application outputs in Markdown format which improves presentation.

    * Application will also attempt to dynamically generate and plot charts to illustrate if relevant to the query.

    # Methodology

    ## Implementation Details

    This is a basic web application bulit using Streamlit, and deployed on the Streamlit Community Cloud.

    Core libraries include ```openai``` and ```matplotlib```

    It uses OpenAI API in various functions to provide natural language processing.
  
    Prompts are revised/extended and crafted from the base code used as part of the AI Champions Bootcamp, to use GenAI to:
    
    1. Verify relevance of query

    2. Determine relevant grouping of query. This technique is used for CPF Contribution AI due to the size of the data file. 
     
    3. Filter, programmatically, larger body of information based on that grouping to a smaller set in order to include into context which is then used to help answer the query. 

    4. Generate datapoints if relevant to enhance understanding of the citizen user, that is compatible to ```matplotlib``` 

    5. Structure and format whole response into a JSON dictionary string which can then be programmed to:

        a) Write answer back to the user

        b) Visualise the data for the user

    Chatbots also helped build the application. ChatGPT was used to: 
    
    1. Provide ideas
    
    2. Rapidly provide the wireframe/skeleton for the application

    4. Explain Python libraries, functions and concepts

    5. Explain exception that the application threw, which helped debugging. 

    4. Code out 'workable' functions, which shortened development time. E.g. Function to handle charting with ```matplotlib``` of datapoints dynamically generated in the OpenAI response would have been very hard to come out with.

    ## Data flows

    1. Data downloaded from CPF in PDF or image were piped to a multimodal LLM to transform to JSON strings representing Python dictionaries.

    2. The JSON strings are sample-reviewed (human-in-the-loop,so to speak) for basic integrity (I'm not a CPF expert), cleaned up and saved as JSON files. 

    3. The program logic can then load the JSON files, to then 'down-filter' or better contextualise the data based on user inputs.
     
    4. This allowed selected, more contextualised, higher quality (in my lay judgment) data to be fed into the system-side message for building the final prompt to answer the query.
